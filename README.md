# Connectivity Graphs Coq Development

This is the repository for the Connectivity Graphs Coq development.
Connectivity graphs are a method for progress and preservation style deadlock and memory leak freedom proofs for languages in which these properties are guaranteed by the type system, such as session typed languages.

To build the code, install the following dependencies:

* A recent version of Coq (we tested with Coq 8.13.2)
* A development version of Iris (we tested with dev.2021-09-27.1.d2c226e7)
* A development version of std++ (we tested with dev.2021-09-27.0.7d5f3593)

You can then compile this project with `make`.

See readme.pdf for more detailed information.
