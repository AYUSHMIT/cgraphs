  \begin{theorem}
    There is a thread that's not blocked.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    We find a thread that's not blocked using this algorithm:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Start at any thread in the connectivity graph.
      \item If the thread is not blocked, we're done.
      \item If the thread is blocked, step to the channel that it's blocked on.
      \item If we're at a channel
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proof}
