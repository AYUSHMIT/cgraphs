* think about different way to do generic invariant and separation logic
* prove connectivity graph lemmas
* using those prove the generic invariant lemmas
* prove preservation using generic invariant library
* figure out adequacy statement for generic invariant
* prove progress using that adequacy statement
* extensions
* write paper
